            <h3>Holding Former President Trump Accountable</h3>
            <p>Judge Amit Mehta, presiding over Lee vs. Trump, the first civil legal
                action seeking to hold the former president accountable for his conduct
                connected to the January 6th insurrection and efforts to overturn the 2020 election,
                denied Trump the absolute immunity from suit that has always been
                afforded to presidents in the past for conduct occurring while serving in office.</p>

            <p>NAACP was on the ground in key battleground states and deployed lawyers
                throughout the nation to monitor and respond to reports of voter suppression
                through their Voter Protection Hub,
                ensuring that every American was provided an opportunity to cast their ballot.</p>

            <h3>Protecting Democracy in Alabama</h3>
            <p>The NAACP Alabama State Conference were plaintiffs in the June Supreme
                Court case against Alabama where they rightfully argued that the state's congressional
                map was a clear attempt to minimize the voting power of the state's Black residents. The Supreme Court
                ruled in favor of drawing a new Alabama congressional
                map which will allow for greater representation of Black voters in the state.</p>

            <p>
                NAACP and Brookings have partnered on The Black Progress Index, a new analysis of the places where
                Black people are thriving most, as measured through their life expectancy. In the spirit of W.E.B. Du
                Bois,
                we're working to provide insight into the local civic actions that can improve life expectancy outcomes.
